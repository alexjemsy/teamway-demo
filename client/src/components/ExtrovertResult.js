    <h2>You are more of an extrovert</h2>
    <p>
      Whether at work or at home, you are a leader, the head of the pack.
      You are the type of person who is at ease with everyone — with the grocer, the doctor, a managing director or a
      waiter.
      You have an opinion about just about everything and you like to share your knowledge around, even imposing it on
      others if they haven’t asked for it.
      Your personal and professional entourages easily class you as a ‘loud mouth’, sure about yourself, not in the
      least bit bothered about what others think of you and someone who occasionally likes to play the card of
      provocation.
      When you’re on a roll, it’s hard to sop you and the least that could be said is that listening skills are not one
      of your innate skills.
      In the couples arena, you have maybe fallen for someone with a similar temperament – making for animated evenings!
      Or on the contrary, you live with a more introverted partner over whom you can, in some cases, have the upper
      hand.
      Your confidence and exuberance are a strong motor for your highly colourful life and you are a real antidote to
      any hint of grey skies or boredom. It’s perhaps the moments of excess activity or confidence that you need to
      question. Your capacity to be over the top can make others feel that you consider yourself as the most important
      person, that you have to be the centre of attention to feel loved and thus to exist, unless of course these are
      ways of pre-empting judgement from others. Do you worry about leaving others indifferent if you’re not perpetually
      ‘on show’? Maybe this need for attention is to compensate your own self-judgement? Your energy levels and
      enthusiasm are unquestionable, but are you as comfortable receiving as giving? Have you actually listened to
      anyone recently, without butting in? Do you know how to stay by yourself and do nothing else but be with yourself?
      A few questions that could be interesting to ask yourself…
